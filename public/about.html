<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Josh Bishop, 27 years old and from Mansfield, England</p>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer who has just started out in this exciting field. I have always had a keen interest in how websites work and the 'behind the scenes' of computer software, but finally had the courage to start pursuing a career in it.</p>
<p>Away from web development, I am always watching football or anime, listening to music or reading a book</p>
